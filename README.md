# Book-project
This project was done as part of Concordia's Introduction to Software Engineering course.<br>
Original repositories: [frontend](https://github.com/EternalUpdate/book-project), [backend](https://github.com/bryce-n-dev/book-project-api).
This is a copy on my personal github to showcase it in one place.

This website allows the user to log books they have read (favourite books, "To read" list, "Reading List", etc.)
